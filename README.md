## Introduction

This project serves as an example of building a Node.js application using Express framework. It follows Node.js best practices to ensure a clean and well-structured codebase. The project includes middleware for logging HTTP requests, demonstrating how to integrate middleware into an Express application.

## Features

- Express framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- Middleware for logging HTTP requests.
- Follows Node.js best practices for project organization and structure.
- Basic required modules like `express` and `morgan`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone <https://<GIT_USER_NAME>:<GIT_CLASSIC_TOKEN>@github.com/AddWebSolution/nodejs-code-snippet.git>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd node-express-project-example
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure:

```
node-express-project-example/
  |- src/
  |   |- controllers/         # Contains controller files for handling routes
  |   |   |- [NAME OF CONTROLLER].js
  |   |- middleware/         # Contains custom middleware functions
  |   |   |- [NAME OF MIDDLEWARE].js
  |   |- routes/             # Contains route files defining application routes
  |   |   |- index.js
  |   |- services/           # Contains service files for business logic
  |   |   |- [NAME OF SERVICE].js  
  |   |   |- db.js           # Database connection file
  |   |- utils/              # Contains utility files

  |- package.json            # Defines project dependencies and scripts
  |- README.md               # Documentation providing information about the project
```

## Database

The project includes a `db.js` file within the `services` directory for managing the database connection. This file is responsible for connecting to the database using a MongoDB URI.

## Middleware

The project includes middleware for logging HTTP requests. This middleware logs details such as request method, URL, and timestamp for each incoming request. Middleware are registered in the Express application to be executed on every request.
